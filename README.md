# BetterLogs
Minecraft's logs do not record items renamed in an anvil, contents written onto a sign or anything put into a book. These are huge security flaws and trolls know it.
This information needs to be recorded and visible in console. With BetterLogs, staff can watch the full contents of these actions, as well as sign placements, as they happen via console access or be able to go back any time to look up this data in the server logs.
Improve your logs to catch troll activity with BetterLogs.

## Features

- Items renamed in anvils are recorded in the server logs
- Sign contents along with the world and x,y,x coordinates are recorded in the server logs
- Book contents on edit and signed books are recorded in the server logs
- Real time alerts can be sent via in game chat to staff with appropriate permissions

## Permissions
- betterlogs.alerts.*
- betterlogs.alerts.anvil
